Follow this guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world (I made my repository private).  After you have completed the guide once, step away for a day and repeat the guide from memory starting with creating a new branch.  I want you to learn the process:
* Branching, 
* Committing, 
* Eequesting a pull, 
* Verifying the code, 
* Merging (or rejecting) the request, and 
* Deleting the branch if no longer needed

After you have practiced this a few times, submit a screen shot like this:

This isn’t to teach you how to code, it’s to teach you how to manage code.
We do it several over a few days so you'll remember it.
